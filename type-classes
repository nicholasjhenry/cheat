1. A *functor* is a data type that implements the Functor typeclass.
An *applicative* is a data type that implements the Applicative typeclass.
A *monad* is a data type that implements the Monad typeclass.
A Maybe implements all three, so it is a functor, an applicative, and a monad.

What is the difference between the three?

* functors: you apply a function to a wrapped value using fmap or <$>
* applicatives: you apply a wrapped function to a wrapped value using <*> or liftA
* monads: you apply a function that returns a wrapped value, to a wrapped value using >>= or liftM
